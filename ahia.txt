*** Communication Flow

1. IAM:
    - User Registration and Authentication.
        - iam service emits a user created event to the event bus.
        - Other services (i.e email notification service, analytics service) can subscribe to this event for further processing.
    - Realtor Updates Availability Status.
        - iam service emits a status updated event to the event bus.
        - Other services (i.e availability service) subscribes to this event for further processing.  

2. Listing:
   - Provider creates/updates/deletes a listing via listing service.
   - listing service emits events to the event bus.
   - iam service listens to these events to update the provider's listing records.

3. Tour:
   - Customer adds listings to the cart using cart service.
   - Customer proceeds to payment via payment service.
   - Upon successful payment, payment service emits a payment success event.
    - Tour Service
        - listens to this event to create a tour.
        - emits new tour created event.
        - assignment service fetches available realtors based on location via availability service.
        - tour service notifies assignment service to assign a realtor.
        - assignment service updates realtor status and notifies availability service.
        - tour service notifies scheduling service to schedule the appointment.
        - scheduling service finalizes the appointment and notifies the customer and realtor.
    - Iam Service
        - listens to this event and updates customers payment records.

*** Implementation Logic

1. Event Bus Implementation
   - A message broker i.e. RabbitMQ, or AWS SNS/SQS/Eventbridge for asynchronous communication.
   - Services should be able to publish and subscribe to relevant events.

2. Realtor Availability, Assignment and Appointment Scheduling
   - availability service maintains a cache of realtor statuses using Redis or another in-memory store.
   - tour service calls availability service to get real-time status.
   - scheduling service uses this information to schedule tours and update statuses.
